Thirteen spooktacular games to play, hack, and slash this Halloween
content:
With Halloween creeping up (and Game Off just days away), we thought you might enjoy some fun, fiendish, and forkable games that have risen from game jams over the years. For the undead uninitiated, game jams are hackathons for building games in just a few days or weeks based on a theme or some other constraint like limitations to CGA color palettes, total filesize no more than 13kB, or fitting an entire game into a 64¡Á64 pixel canvas. They¡¯re fun, challenging, and we¡¯ve seen some spooktacular creations!We¡¯re covering 13 games with ghosts, ghouls, demons, daemons, witches, worms, and a myriad of monsters from jams like CGAJam, Global Game Jam, JS13K, LowResJam, and Ludum Dare. Play them alone in the dark, or fork them and make some tweaks to the source to give yourself an advantage. We¡¯ve provided a few cheat codes to get you started. ??
