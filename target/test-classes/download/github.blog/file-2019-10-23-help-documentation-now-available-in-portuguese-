Good news! Our help documentation site, help.github.com, is now available in Brazilian Portuguese. Brazil is an emerging market and with the addition of documentation in Portuguese, we hope to welcome more developers in Brazil to the GitHub community and provide the resources they need to code, create, and collaborate.Our new Brazilian Portuguese site includes documentation for GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Desktop, and GitHub Pages. You can access our Portuguese language site by visiting help.github.com, and then selecting Portugu¨ºs from the language selection drop-down menu, located on the top right of the website, or by visiting help.github.com/pt.We¡¯re always translating new documentation to provide information in your preferred language. Our help site runs on a continuous integration system with Crowdin, a localization tool and one of our GitHub Marketplace partners. Continuous integration allows us to always publish the latest articles in Portuguese or any other GitHub-supported language. You may notice that some sentences within a translated article are in English. This means the content was recently added to the site and is currently in a queue waiting to be translated¡ªif you find text still in English, check back in a few days for the translation.Our site also offers a search engine that supports Brazilian Portuguese. To try it out, type any search topic in the search bar of the Brazilian Portuguese site at help.github.com/pt.As the world becomes increasingly connected, we¡¯re working to support our global community of developers as they build the future of software, regardless of the languages they speak, and to add even more languages and more translated sites, like developer.github.com. Help us by sharing the new Brazilian Portuguese language site in your community.Explore our help documentation in Brazilian PortugueseThis year, Github is participating in the Python Brazil 2019 Conference, the largest Python programming event in Brazil, in Ribeir?o Preto from October 23-28.
