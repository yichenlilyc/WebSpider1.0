New workflow editor for GitHub Actions
content:
It¡¯s now even easier to create and edit a GitHub Actions workflow with the updated editor. We¡¯ve provided inline auto-complete and lint as you type so you can say goodbye to YAML indentation issues and explore the full workflow syntax without going to the docs.Auto-complete can be triggered with Ctrl+Space almost anywhere, and in some cases, automatically. It suggests keys or values depending on the current position of the cursor, and displays brief contextual documentation so you can discover and understand all the available options without losing the focus. Auto-complete works even inside expressions.Additionally, the editor will insert a new line with the right indentation when you press enter. It will also either suggest the next key to insert or insert code snippets that you can navigate through using the tab key.Snippets also work when using functions inside expressions, allowing you to easily write and navigate through the required arguments.There are many updates to help you write workflow files, but if you make a mistake, we¡¯ve got you covered too.The editor now highlights structural errors in your file, unexpected values, or even conflicting values, such as an invalid shell value for the chosen operating system.Finally, the editor will also help you edit your scheduled jobs by describing the cron expressions you have used with natural language:These are just a few features we¡¯ve made to help you edit workflows with fewer errors. We¡¯d love to hear any feedback you have¡ªshare your questions and comments with us in the GitHub Actions Community Forum.Learn more about GitHub Actions
