GitHub Sponsors is now out of beta and generally available to developers with bank accounts in 30 countries and growing.Since GitHub Sponsors launched, the beta has grown exponentially, reaching tens of thousands of developers in the GitHub community. It¡¯s been amazing to see what open source developers have already done with sponsorships in just a few months.Hear just a few of the talented developers who participated in the beta describe what GitHub Sponsors means to them:Our small team was busy this summer. We¡¯ve spoken to hundreds of open source developers and sponsors, merged hundreds of pull requests, and added many of the key features that our patient beta users requested¡ªand there¡¯s still so much more to do!This is just the beginning for native sponsorships on GitHub. We¡¯re working hard to build out great sponsorship experiences around the world.If you don¡¯t have a bank account in one of the 30 countries where GitHub Sponsors is generally available, you can still sign up on the waitlist to join the beta in your country. You¡¯ll also receive news about when GitHub Sponsors is generally available.In the coming months, we¡¯ll continue to roll out general availability to countries where GitHub does business, incorporate feedback, and improve the tools you need to connect with the community you depend on and collaborate with.Learn more about GitHub Sponsors
