Self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions is now in beta
content:
Since we announced GitHub Actions support for CI/CD In August, self-hosted runners have been one of the most eagerly anticipated updates¡ªand it¡¯s now available in beta.Self-hosted runners offer a number of advantages when the hosted virtual environments don¡¯t meet all your needs:To get started, you must be an administrator to change any configurations. Once logged in, navigate to the Actions tab from your repository¡¯s settings. You should see a new section where you can manage your self-hosted runners.Click the Add runner button, select the platform you¡¯re targeting, and then follow the sequence of shell commands to download, configure, and run your runner.During configuration, the CLI will prompt you to answer a few questions, including naming the runner, and determining the output directory for any jobs.Once your runner is successfully configured and listening for jobs, it will display as idle which means you¡¯re ready to update your workflow.To support using self-hosted runners in your workflows, we¡¯ve expanded the experience of using the runs-on key. When registering your self-hosted runners, they¡¯re each given a read-only label self-hosted which you can use with runs-on. Here¡¯s an example:In addition to the self-hosted label, each runner is also given read-only labels that identify its platform and architecture.Since self-hosted runners have more than one label, you can provide a single label, or array of labels to runs-on. These allow you to filter the runners to only those that include the specific label values you specify. Here¡¯s an example where we filter labels:Adding your own custom labels to self-hosted runners is currently not supported, but we hope to release it in a future iteration.We know that flexibility and control are critical when it comes to your CI/CD setup, so we¡¯re excited to add self-hosted runners as a new way to use GitHub Actions. You can start adding your own self-hosted runners through the Actions tab in your repository¡¯s setting page, and we look forward to hearing what other features you need!Learn more about self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions
